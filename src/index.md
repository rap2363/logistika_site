# Hello!

I'm Rohan. I help people and companies solve hard problems through systems-level thinking, optimization, and coaching. Here are the three things I love to do:

1. Work on hard problems with great people.
2. Help people learn and receive amazing insight or moments of clarity.
3. Do a lot of math!

Whether you're a company looking to scale your algorithms and systems, or an engineer wanting to deepen your math and computer science foundations, I'd love to work with you.
